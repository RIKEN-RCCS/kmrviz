KMRViz is a visualization tool that visualizes traces of a KMR (MapReduce for K supercomputer) program as timelines of processes (nodes/ranks).

=============
Prerequisites
=============

KMRViz is dependant on:

- GTK+3 library - a cross-platform GUI toolkit: although GTK+ 3.0 is almost ok (runnable) a version >= 3.10 is recommended (GTK+2 is not compatible)
  Ubuntu 14.04: libgtk-3-dev package (sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev)
  CentOS 7.0: gtk3-devel package (su -c 'yum install gtk3-devel')


=============
Compile
=============

Normal case:

  $ make

On K supercomputer (front-end node):

  $ export PATH=/opt/aics/gtk-3.0/bin:$PATH
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/aics/gtk-3.0/lib64:/opt/aics/gtk-3.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ export XDG_DATA_DIRS=/opt/aics/gtk-3.0/share
  $ make -f Makefile.kf


=============
Run
=============

For now, you should run "./kmrviz" executable from its compile directory because it requires the GTK GUI markup file by the "./gui/menubar.ui" path name (will be fixed):

  $ ./kmrviz ~/scratch/kmr/00kt_rank*.bin
